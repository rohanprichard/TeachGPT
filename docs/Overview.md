# Overview

TeachGPT is a client–server chatbot system designed for education. Its primary goal is to assist students by providing interactive, personalized responses based on academic documents and context. 

## Key Features
- **Client–Server Architecture:** Separates the front end (built with React) from the back end (developed using FastAPI).
- **Document Embedding:** Processes and indexes educational content, such as PDFs and PPTX files, using a vector store.
- **Chatbot Interaction:** Leverages state-of-the-art AI models (either via OpenAI's endpoint or a local model) to generate context-aware responses.
- **User and Course Management:** Supports user registration, login, and the management of courses and educational materials through dedicated interfaces.
- **Admin and Client Frontends:** Provides a dedicated admin interface for content management and a client interface for student interactions.

## Intended Audience
- **Students** looking for academic help.
- **Administrators** managing educational materials.
- **Developers** needing to understand or extend system functionality.
