# TeachGPT 

This is my final year project, a client-server chatbot system for educational institutions. It is a comprehensive system that allows students to interact with an AI chatbot, faculty to upload educational documents, and administrators to manage courses and documents, as well as handle scaling with ease.


## Tech Stack:
 - FastAPI 
 - SQLAlchemy 
 - Chroma
 - OpenAI
 - React
 - Docker


 ## Documentation
 I've created a documentation site with detailed information about the system architecture, backend API, database schema, modules, frontend interfaces, and setup instructions.
